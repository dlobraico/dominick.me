  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm a fourth year at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University
  of Chicago</a> expecting Bachelor of Arts degrees in Computer
  Science and Public Policy in June of 2013. After graduation I'll be
  moving back to the east coast to work in New York City.</p>

  <p>I've been wanting a place to call my online home since I shutdown
  my middle school blog but just haven't had the time to get around to
  building something satisfactory. This is a first attempt at filling
  that void. I'm not sure what I'll post here but I think more often
  than not it will be links with short descriptions or brief ramblings
  about whatever I find interesting enough to mention.</p>

  <p>This site serves a second purpose in that I have been using my
  time spent working on it to try out some new web development
  options. An initial prototype was written in Clojure with the
  excellent <a href="http://www.webnoir.org">Noir web
  framework</a>. The current iteration is a custom-written and
  standalone <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> application that uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp">cohttp</a> to
  implement a simple web server
  and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow">COW</a> to
  implement some simplistic templating.</p>

  <p>You can reach me by emailing the address composed of my first
  initial at lobraico.com.</p>
